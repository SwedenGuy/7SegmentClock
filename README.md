This project uses an Arudino and a DS1302 real time clock module to display the time on a 3D printed 7 segment flip display which is driven by 28 servos. The servos are controlled by two PCA9685 16 channel PWM drivers, one driving the hours and one driving the minutes. The circuit diagram and 3D print files are available in the project guide.

Please ask any project related questions or questions relating to the hardware and build process on the project guide.
